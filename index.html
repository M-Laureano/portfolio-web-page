    <h2>About Michelle</h2>
    <p>I have been interested in the world of tech since in my early teens. There use to be a website by the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace"> Myspace</a>, where I discovered I was coding without knowing it. A passion was born!  </p>
    <p>Now, I'm working towards becoming a Thinkful student while I finish my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.</p>
    <p>Besides my passion for technology, you can find me gardening or writing short stories. </p>
